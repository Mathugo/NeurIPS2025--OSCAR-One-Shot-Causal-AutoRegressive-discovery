# OSCAR- One Shot Causal AutoRegressive discovery

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper "One-Shot Multi-Label Causal Discovery in High-Dimensional Event Sequences", which introduces OSCAR: a novel approach for rapid causal discovery in high-dimensional, multi-label event sequences.

## Why Use OSCAR?
Causal discovery in event sequences is challenging due to the high dimensionality and complex temporal dependencies in real-world data. OSCAR addresses this by leveraging the expressive power of pretrained autoregressive models, making it uniquely suited for applications like:

Industrial fault diagnostics

Medical event analysis (e.g., disease progression)

Complex system monitoring (e.g., network logs, cyberattack detection)

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install torch transformers accelerate datasets numpy
```

Depending on your pretrained Transformer $\text{Tf}_x, \text{Tf}_y$ you might need additional packages.

## Settings & Pretraining

### Reuse the data from the paper

If you want to reuse the data, a parquet files containing 300,000 sequences of error codes are given under: *data/ds_test.parquet*
Which contains already tokenised and encoded events and labels. The ground truth Markov Boundary for each label (0 to 474) is given in 
*data/mb_labels.json*.

### Preparing Your Data 

Before using OSCAR, you need to train two autoregressive models:
1. Next Event Model ($\text{Tf}_x$): Predicts the next event in a sequence.
2. Next Label Model ($\text{Tf}_y$): Predicts the outcome labels given the current event and history.

Your training data should consist of sequences of events () and associated labels (), which may include:

* Events: Error codes, system logs, clinical symptoms
* Labels: Critical failures, disease diagnoses, system malfunctions

Ensure that your data is properly tokenised and prepared as required by your chosen transformer model.

### Training the models
You should first pretrain these models to estimate the following conditionals:

$P_{\theta_x}(X_i|\boldsymbol{Z})$ and 
$P_{\theta_y}(Y_j|X_i, \boldsymbol{Z})$ 

where $X_i$ is the candidate cause event and $Y_j$ is the effect label and $\boldsymbol{Z}$ is the observed event history$.

## Inference

### Assumptions

It is important to note that OSCAR assume:
* *Temporal Precedence*: The sequence of events is correctly recorded such that ordered event $x_i$ is allowed to influence any subsequence $x_j$ such that $t_i \leq t_j$ and $i<j$.
* *Bounded Lagged Effects*: Once we observed events up to a timestamp $t_i$, any future lagged copy of event $X^{t_i + \tau}_i$ does not additionally influence $Y_j$. In other words, we restrict the causal influence in a small interval once $X_i$ occurs. 
* *Causal Sufficiency*: All variables are observed
* *Oracle Models*: $\text{Tf}_x, \text{Tf}_y$ are trained perfectly such that they approximate the true distribution of the observed data.

### Batch inference
*Case: A batch of unobserved sequences needs to be explained in terms of causality between events and label occurrence by an operator. Using previously trained autoregressive sequence models on the same domain, OSCAR returns the indices of the events causing each label for each sequence. Every operation is parallelised on GPUs.

    filtered_probs /= filtered_probs.sum(dim=-1, keepdim=True)

    # Unscramble to match the original top-k indices
    # Need to reorder the sorted indices back to the original top-k
    reorder_idx = torch.argsort(sorted_idx, dim=-1)
    filtered_probs = torch.gather(filtered_probs, -1, reorder_idx)

    batched_probs = filtered_probs.unsqueeze(1).repeat(1, n, 1, 1)        # (bs, n, seq_len, k)
    batched_indices = topk_indices.unsqueeze(1).repeat(1, n, 1, 1)        # (bs, n, seq_len, k)

    sampled_idx = sampled_idx.view(-1, n, c).unsqueeze(-1)

## Evaluation

### Vehicular Event Dataset
OSCAR was evaluated on a test dataset of diagnostic trouble codes (as $X$) leading to failures of vehicles, namely error pattern(s) (as $Y_j$). It is composed of about 29,100 different diagnostic trouble codes and 474 error patterns. The dataset is characterised by a long-tail problem for the error pattern, such that the labels are highly imbalanced.

We reused the two pretrained Transformers $\text{Tf}_x$: *CarFormer* and $\text{Tf}_y$: *EPredictor* [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13041) to perform the CI-tests on this dataset.
The evaluation of the different experiments is given under *eval.py*.

Standard multi-label causal discovery methods are not well adapted to high-dimensional event sequences, as they cannot solve in a reasonable amount of time.
Moreover, it is easier to provide explanation for an operator per-sample on unobserved data (one-shot) rather than solving the complete causal discovery problem across all the observational data (especially when having a lot of # event types and labels). Results might appear poor, however, error patterns (labels) are imbalanced and getting refined over time by a domain expert, making it more difficult to extract the correct Markov Boundary, especially in a one-shot manner.
